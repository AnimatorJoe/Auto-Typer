## Why I'm Making This

So I'm taking this cs class over the summer, and the TAs decide that it would be interesting to host a typeracer clone on the class website.

Well I went on to take a try and boy was I blown away by the typing speed of my fellow classmates. There was one kid who managed 215 WPM, which I'm pretty sure beat some old world records. I tried my hardest and best and only pulled in at around 77 WPM >_< ... 

At some point I decided to say "screw it" and took the logical next step of writing a bot that did the typing for me.
